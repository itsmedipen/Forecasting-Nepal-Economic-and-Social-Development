# Forecasting Nepal‚Äôs Economic and Social Development  

This project was developed as part of the internship requirement for the course **‚ÄúPython with Data Science‚Äù**.  
The objective is to build a **Time Series Forecasting Model** to predict Nepal‚Äôs economic and social development indicators and deploy the results as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.  

The project uses data from the **World Bank API (via pandas_datareader)** and applies **Facebook Prophet** for time series forecasting.

## üìå Project Overview  

Nepal‚Äôs development progress is studied and forecasted using **four key indicators**:  

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):**  
   Total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country‚Äôs borders in one year.  
   - In Nepal, GDP increased from **1.94B USD (1980)** to **42.9B USD (2024)**.  

2. **Life Expectancy:**  
   Average number of years a person is expected to live.  
   - In Nepal, life expectancy rose from **48 years** to **70 years**.  

3. **Total Population:**  
   The total number of people living in Nepal.  
   - Grew from **15.5M** to **29.7M** over 45 years.  

4. **GDP per Capita:**  
   Average economic output per person, calculated as GDP √∑ Population.  
   - Increased from **$125** to **$1,447**.  

üëâ Units: GDP and Total Population are expressed in **billions**, and currency is in **USD**.  
üëâ Note: The **Literacy Rate** column was dropped due to **84% missing values**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps in the Project  

### 1. **Data Collection**  
- Source: World Bank API (via `pandas_datareader`)  
- Time period: **1980 ‚Äì 2024**  

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- Dropped **Literacy Rate** (too many missing values)  
- Forward-filled missing values in **Life Expectancy** (2.22% missing)  
- Dropped **country** column  
- Converted **year** to datetime and set as index  

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualized each variable using **line and bar charts**  
- Observations:  
  - GDP growth accelerated after 2003  
  - Life Expectancy gradually improved year by year  
  - Population nearly doubled in 45 years  
  - GDP per capita followed GDP‚Äôs upward trend  

### 4. **Feature Engineering**  
- Created **GDP per Capita** = GDP √∑ Total Population  

### 5. **Model Building**  
- Used **Prophet** to build forecasting models for all four indicators  

### 6. **Train-Test Split & Evaluation**  
- Train set: **1980‚Äì2015**  
- Test set: **2016‚Äì2024**  
- Evaluated using **MAE** and **RMSE**  
- Results: **All models achieved MAE and RMSE < 16**, indicating strong accuracy  

### 7. **Model Optimization**  
- Since errors are already low, **cross-validation was not required**  

### 8. **Model Saving**  
- Models serialized with **Pickle** for deployment  

### 9. **Deployment**  
- Deployed as a **Streamlit Web App** for interactive forecasting
